# Total Thermonuclear War

This program is my version of the DOS program from the 1983 cult classic 'War Games',
In this movie, a young hacker unwittingly accesses a military supercomputer programmed to predict outcomes of nuclear war.
Thinking it is a computer game, he runs a simulation. The computer, tied into the nuclear weapons control system
and unable to tell the difference between simulation and reality, attempts to start World War III.

Screenshots from the original: https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/global-thermonuclear-war/screenshots/gameShotId,676012/

This game features the use of several C++ constructs (arrays, loops, etc) and is purposely slowed down in many places to simulate the output of a 1980's computer :-=)

.... Are you ready to play?
